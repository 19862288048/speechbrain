# Speech enhancement on **RescueSpeech**
This folder contains speech enhancement recipes using [SepFormer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13154) for the [RescueSpeech dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/8077622) (`Task_enhancement.tar.gz`)

Additional dependency:
```
pip install pesq librosa pystoi mir_eval
```

We use SepFormer speech enhancement model first trained on 1300 HRS of Deep Noise Suppression (DNS)Challenge 4 dataset and further fine-tune on **~7h** of RescueSpeech noisy dataset.

## How to run?
```
python train.py hparams/sepformer_16k.yaml
```
## Results
Results on RescueSpeech test set are as follows:

| Metric | Before fine-tuning | After fine-tuning |
| ------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| SISNRi | 4.621              | 7.849             |
| SDRi   | 6.046              | 8.414             |
| PESQ   | 1.940              | 2.244             |
| STOI   | 0.764              | 0.812             |
| CSIG   | 2.852              | 3.282             |
| CBAK   | 1.993              | 2.169             |
| COVL   | 2.358              | 2.750             |

- The output folder with the model checkpoints and logs for WHAMR! is available *add full model drive link*.
- It takes around 30 mins per epoch to train on RTXA6000 48 GB GPU.

## Pretrained Models
Pretrained models for SepFormer on DNS-4 dataset can be found through:
- HuggingFace : *add hf link to sepformer_dns_16k*
- Full Model Link: *add drive link to sepformer_dns_16k*
