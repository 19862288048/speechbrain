# **RescueSpeech** ASR with seq2seq model
This folder contains the script to fine-tune a seq2seq CNN-RNN-based model on the RescueSpeech dataset.
The model is first trained on German CommonVoice10.0 corpus, and later fine-tuned on the RescueSpeech data.
- See *Gdrive link* for the CommonVoice10.0 pre-trained ASR model, tokenizer and Language Model.

# How to run
As discussed in the paper we use multiple training strategies to create a robust speech recognition system that operates in the SAR (search and rescue) domain.

1. **Pre-training**: Use the CommonVoice pre-trained seq2seq CRDNN model and directly infer on RescueSpeech dataset (clean/noisy inputs) without any fine-tuning.
    ```
    python train.py hparams/train.yaml --number_of_epochs 0 --input_type clean_wav/noisy_wav
    ```

2. **Clean-training**: Fine-tune the ASR model on RescueSpeech clean dataset.
    ```
    python train.py hparams/train.yaml --input_type clean_wav
    ```

3. **Multi-condition training**: Fine-tune the ASR model on an equal mix of clean and noisy audio from the RescueSpeech noisy dataset.
    ```
    python train.py hparams/train.yaml --input_type clean_noisy_mix
    ```

*Note* <br>
To ensure accurate inference on clean and noisy inputs, please modify the `pretrained_asr` parameter in the `train.yaml` file accordingly. When conducting inference for the clean training strategy, ensure that `pretrained_asr` points to the best saved checkpoint obtained during clean training (similarly for multi-condition training). Additionally, it is recommended to perform inference on both clean and noisy test inputs for comprehensive evaluation.


# Test Results
Here we show test WERs using different training strategies on clean and noisy speech inputs from RescueSpeech dataset.
Clean WER and Noisy WER represent WER on clean and noisy test inputs respectively.
