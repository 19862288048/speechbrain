# Noise robust speech recognition on RescueSpeech dataset
[RescuSpeech](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8077622) is a dataset specifically designed for performing noise robust speech recognition in the Search and Rescue domain. In this repository, we provide training recipes and pre-trained models for the best setup that have been developed and evaluated using RescuSpeech data. This aim to enhance the performance of speech recognizers in challenging and noisy environments.

Our paper compares ASR models (CRDNN, Wav2vec2, WavLM, Whisper) and speech-enhancement systems (SepFormer). But here we present our best-performing models achieved using the best strategy. See below for pre-trained model details and the full model link.

This recipe supports a simple combination of a speech enhancement model (**SepFormer**) and an ASR (**Whisper**) model. The models are trained jointly and then combined to tackle noise interference.

## How to run
```
python train.py hparams/robust_asr_16k.yaml
```

## Results
During training, both speech enhancement and ASR is kept unfrozen.

| Model | SISNRi | SDRi | PESQ   | STOI  | *WER*   |
|------ |--------|-------|-------|-------|----   |
| Whisper (`large-v2`)| 7.334 | 7.871 | 2.085 | 0.857 | **24.20** |

## Pretrained Models
We initially perform fine-tuning of both the ASR model and SepFormer model using the CommonVoice dataset and the Microsoft-DNS dataset. Subsequently, we proceed with a second stage of fine-tuning on our RescueSpeech dataset. Here you can find links to the trained models.
