# Summary

This recipe implements the following:

- A classification training script (`train.py`) for the ESC50 multiclass sound classification dataset. This classification is mainly adapted from the Speechbrain UrbanSound8k recipe. The classification recipe makes use of a [CNN14 model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10211) pretrained on the [VGG Sound](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/vggsound/) dataset with self-supervised learning.

- [Listen to Interpret](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11479v2) which makes use of Non-Negative Matrix Factorization to reconstruct the classifier hidden representation in order to provide an interpretation audio signal for the classifier decision. The corresponding training script is `train_l2i.py`.

- A training script to train an NMF dictionary matrix required for L2I. This script is called `train_nmf.py`.
