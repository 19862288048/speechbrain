"""
Creates data manifest files from UrbanSound8k, suitable for use in SpeechBrain.

https://urbansounddataset.weebly.com/urbansound8k.html

From the authors of UrbanSound8k:

1. Don't reshuffle the data! Use the predefined 10 folds and perform 10-fold (not 5-fold) cross validation
The experiments conducted by vast majority of publications using UrbanSound8K (by ourselves and others)
evaluate classification models via 10-fold cross validation using the predefined splits*.
We strongly recommend following this procedure.

Why?
If you reshuffle the data (e.g. combine the data from all folds and generate a random train/test split)
you will be incorrectly placing related samples in both the train and test sets, leading to inflated
scores that don't represent your model's performance on unseen data. Put simply, your results will be wrong.
Your results will NOT be comparable to previous results in the literature, meaning any claims to an
improvement on previous research will be invalid. Even if you don't reshuffle the data, evaluating using
different splits (e.g. 5-fold cross validation) will mean your results are not comparable to previous research.

2. Don't evaluate just on one split! Use 10-fold (not 5-fold) cross validation and average the scores
We have seen reports that only provide results for a single train/test split, e.g. train on folds 1-9,
test on fold 10 and report a single accuracy score. We strongly advise against this. Instead, perform
10-fold cross validation using the provided folds and report the average score.

Why?
Not all the splits are as "easy". That is, models tend to obtain much higher scores when trained on folds
1-9 and tested on fold 10, compared to (e.g.) training on folds 2-10 and testing on fold 1. For this reason,
it is important to evaluate your model on each of the 10 splits and report the average accuracy.
Again, your results will NOT be comparable to previous results in the literature.

â€‹* 10-fold cross validation using the predefined folds: train on data from 9 of the 10 predefined folds and
test on data from the remaining fold. Repeat this process 10 times (each time using a different set of
9 out of the 10 folds for training and the remaining fold for testing). Finally report the average classification
accuracy over all 10 experiments (as an average score + standard deviation, or, even better, as a boxplot).
