# Text-to-Speech (with LJSpeech)
This folder contains the recipes for training TTS systems (including vocoders) wiith the popular LJSpeech dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from here:
https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2

# Installing Extra Dependencies

Before proceeding, ensure you have installed the necessary additional dependencies. To do this, simply run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```

# Tacotron 2
The subfolder "tacotron2" contains the recipe for training the popular [tacotron2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884) TTS model.
To run this recipe, go into the "tacotron2" folder and run:

```
python train.py --device=cuda:0 --max_grad_norm=1.0 --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1npvo1g1ncafipf/AAC5DR1ErF2Q9V4bd1DHqX43a?dl=0).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-tacotron2-ljspeech).

# FastSpeech2
The subfolder "fastspeech2" contains the recipes for training the non-autoregressive transformer based TTS model [FastSpeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558).

### FastSpeech2 with pre-extracted durations from a forced aligner
Training FastSpeech2 requires pre-extracted phoneme alignments (durations). The LJSpeech phoneme alignments from Montreal Forced Aligner can be automatically downloaded, decompressed and stored at this location: ```/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1/TextGrid```.

To run this recipe, please first install the extra-requirements:
```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```
Then go into the "fastspeech2" folder and run:
```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1
```
Training takes about 3 minutes/epoch on 1 * V100 32G.

The training logs are available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tqyp58ogejqfres/AAAtmq7cRoOR3XTsq0iSgyKBa?dl=0).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-fastspeech2-ljspeech).

### FastSpeech2 with internal alignment
This recipe allows training FastSpeech2 without forced aligner referring to [One TTS Alignment To Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10447.pdf). The alignment can be learnt by an internal alignment network that is added to FastSpeech2. This recipe aims to simplify training when using custom data.

To run this recipe, please first install the extra-requirements:
```
pip install -r extra_requirements.txt
```
Then go into the "fastspeech2" folder and run:
```
python train_internal_alignment.py hparams/train_internal_alignment.yaml --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1
```
The data preparation includes a grapheme-to-phoneme process which may take several hours. Training takes about 5 minutes/epoch on 1 * V100 32G.

The training logs are available [here](to be added).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](to be added).

# HiFi GAN (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/hifi_gan/" contains the [HiFi GAN vocoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05646.pdf).
The vocoder is a neural network that converts a spectrogram into a waveform (it can be used on top of Tacotron 2).

We suggest using `tensorboard_logger` by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus `Tensorboard` should be installed.

To run this recipe, go into the "vocoder/hifi_gan/" folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/LJspeech
```

The training logs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19sLwV7nAsnUuLkoTu5vafURA9Fo2WZgG?usp=sharing)

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-hifigan-ljspeech).
