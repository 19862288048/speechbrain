# Text-to-Speech (with LJSpeech)
This folder contains the recipes for training TTS systems (including vocoders) wiith the popular LJSpeech dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from here:
https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2

# Tacotron 2
The subfolder "tacotron2" contains the recipe for training the popular [tacotron2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884) TTS model.
To run this recipe, go into the "tacotron2" folder and run:

```
python train.py --device=cuda:0 --max_grad_norm=1.0 --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```
Training takes about X hours on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CbkXPvtLFVrRBeeuMnmTmNCyagNKO6uX?usp=sharing).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-tacotron2-ljspeech).

# FastSpeech2
The subfolder "fastspeech2" contains the recipe for training the non-autoregressive transformer based TTS model [FastSpeech2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558).

Training FastSpeech2 requires phoneme alignments. The LJSpeech phoneme alignments can be downloaded from here: [LJSpeech.zip](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DBRkALpPd6FL9gjHMmMEdHODmkgNIIK4)
Extract the phoneme alignments in the ```--data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1```. As a result, the phoneme alignments should be stored at this location: ```/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1/TextGrid```.

To run this recipe, go into the "fastspeech2" folder and run:

```
python train.py --device=cuda:0 --max_grad_norm=1.0 --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```
Training takes about 12 hours on an nvidia RTX3090.

The training logs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Yb8CDCrW7JF1_jg8Xc4U15z3W37VjrY5).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-fastspeech2-ljspeech).

# HiFi GAN (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/hifi_gan/" contains the [HiFi GAN vocoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05646.pdf).
The vocoder is a neural network that converts a spectrogram into a waveform (it can be used on top of Tacotroon 2).

We suggest using `tensorboard_logger` by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus `Tensorboard` should be installed.

To run this recipe, go into the "vocoder/hifi_gan/" folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/LJspeech
```

Training takes about X hours on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19sLwV7nAsnUuLkoTu5vafURA9Fo2WZgG?usp=sharing)

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-hifigan-ljspeech).
