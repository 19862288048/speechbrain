# Text-to-Speech (with LJSpeech)
This folder contains the recipes for training TTS systems (including vocoders) wiith the popular LJSpeech dataset.

# Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from here:
https://data.keithito.com/data/speech/LJSpeech-1.1.tar.bz2

# Tacotron 2
The subfolder "tacotron2" contains the recipe for training the popular [tacotron2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05884) TTS model.
To run this recipe, go into the "tacotron2" folder and run:

```
python train.py --device=cuda:0 --max_grad_norm=1.0 --data_folder=/your_folder/LJSpeech-1.1 hparams/train.yaml
```
Training takes about X hours on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1CbkXPvtLFVrRBeeuMnmTmNCyagNKO6uX?usp=sharing).

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-tacotron2-ljspeech).

# HiFi GAN (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/hifi_gan/" contains the [HiFi GAN vocoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.05646.pdf).
The vocoder is a neural network that converts a spectrogram into a waveform (it can be used on top of Tacotroon 2).

We suggest using `tensorboard_logger` by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus `Tensorboard` should be installed.

To run this recipe, go into the "vocoder/hifi_gan/" folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/LJspeech
```

Training takes about 10 minutes/epoch on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19sLwV7nAsnUuLkoTu5vafURA9Fo2WZgG?usp=sharing)

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/speechbrain/tts-hifigan-ljspeech).

# DiffWave (Vocoder)
The subfolder "vocoder/diffwave/" contains the [Diffwave](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.09761.pdf) vocoder.

DiffWave is a versatile diffusion model for audio synthesis, which produces high-fidelity audio in different waveform generation tasks, including neural vocoding conditioned on mel spectrogram, class-conditional generation, and unconditional generation.

Here it serves as a vocoder that converts a spectrogram into a waveform.

To run this recipe, go into the "vocoder/diffwave/" folder and run:

```
python train.py hparams/train.yaml --data_folder /path/to/LJspeech
```

The scripts will output the results to <output_folder>/samples, for every training epoch

We suggest using tensorboard_logger by setting `use_tensorboard: True` in the yaml file, thus Tensorboard should be installed.


For inference, by setting `fast_sampling: True` , a fast sampling can be realized by passing user-defined variance schedules. According to the paper, high-quality audios can be generated with only 6 steps.

Training takes about 10 minutes/epoch on an nvidia RTX8000.

The training logs are available [here](to add)

You can find the pre-trained model with an easy-inference function on [HuggingFace](to add).
