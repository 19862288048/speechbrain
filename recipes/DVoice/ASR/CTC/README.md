# DVoice ASR with CTC based Seq2Seq models.
This folder contains scripts necessary to run an ASR experiment with the DVoice dataset (Darija, Swahili) : [Link](https://zenodo.org/record/6342622). The dataset used to train the Wolof, Fongbe and Amharic languages can be founded here : [Link](https://github.com/besacier/ALFFA_PUBLIC).

# Data preparation
[DVoice](https://dvoice.ma) attempts to provide automatic voice processing solutions for African languages and dialects. We use preprocessing techniques including voice augmentation to fill the data gap for each language.

# How to run
python train.py hparams/{hparam_file}.py

# Languages
Here is a list of the different African languages and dialects that we tested:
- Darija
- Swahili
- Wolof
- Fongbe
- Amharic
- Kabyle

## How to simply use pretrained models to transcribe my audio file?

SpeechBrain provides a simple interface to transcribe audio files with pretrained models. All the necessary information can be found on the different HuggingFace repositories (see the results table above) corresponding to our different models for DVoice.

# ** About DVoice **
DVoice is a community initiative that aims to provide Africa low resources languages with data and models to facilitate their use of voice technologies. The lack of data on these languages makes it necessary to collect data using methods that are specific to each one. Two different approaches are currently used: the DVoice platforms ([https://dvoice.ma](https://dvoice.ma) and [https://dvoice.sn](https://dvoice.sn)), which are based on Mozilla Common Voice, for collecting authentic recordings from the community, and transfer learning techniques for automatically labeling recordings that are retrived from social medias. The DVoice platform currently manages 7 languages including Darija (Moroccan Arabic dialect) whose dataset appears on this version, Wolof, Mandingo, Serere, Pular, Diola and Soninke.

For this project, AIOX Labs the SI2M Laboratory are joining forces to build the future of technologies together.
