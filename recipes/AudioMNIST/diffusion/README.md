# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model Demo
This folder contrains scripts for running a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
generative model with the [AudioMNIST](https://huggingface.co/datasets/flexthink/audiomnist) dataset, which contains recordings
of spoken English digits in a variety of voices and accents.

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models are a classes of generative
models based on the key idea of training a neural network model, which, given a sample with added noise, can identify that noise and,
during inference, can generate a sample by reconstructing it from 
pure noise in a stepwise manner. The method is inspired by Langevin
dynamics.

Generation can be unconditioned, where the model will generate an 
arbitrary sample from the target distribution, or conditioned, where
it will generate samples given a class label or a prompt.

Diffusion models can operate in the original sample space, but for 
high-dimensional samples, such as full-resolution images, this can
be too slow during inference time. A common approach to addressing
this is latent diffusion (https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752). This
recipe supports both sample-space (spectrogram-space) and latent
diffusion.

This recipe implements a basic DDPM to generate speech samples using
the AudioMNIST dataset. It can be used to train an unconditioned model, a model conditioned on the speaker or on the digit label.

# Training
For the unconditioned model, run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml`

For the model conditioned on the speaker, run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml --speaker_conditioned true`

For the model conditioned on the digit (i.e. a vastly simplified TTS use case), run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml --digit_conditioned true`

For the latent diffusion model, run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train_latent.yaml`

The scripts will output the results to <output_folder>/samples, for every training epoch
