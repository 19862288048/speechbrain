# Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model Demo
This folder contrains scripts for running a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model
generative model with the [AudioMNIST](https://huggingface.co/datasets/flexthink/audiomnist) dataset.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11239.pdf


# Training
For the unconditioned model, run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml`

For the model conditioned on the speaker, run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml --speaker_conditioned true`

For the model conditioned on the digit (i.e. a vastly simplified TTS use case), run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train.yaml --digit_conditioned true`

For the latent diffusion model, run the following:
`python train.py hparams/train_latent.yaml`

The scripts will output the results to <output_folder>/samples, for every training epoch
