# SpeechBrain
# Description: This configuration file computes MFCC and FBANK features (by running the execute computation function with cfg_file=cfg/features/mfcc_features.cfg).
#	       The two features are then concatenated to form a single feature vector.
# 	       This configuration file can be called by the loop function and processes batches on signals.
